    desc: `I always think that every frontend developer should have their own's profolio website. For me, the website is not just for persent, I can do something interesting in this webiste. Combines different thing together and do something out of company like A-frame, threejs, test, storybook, travisCI..etc. Maybe it's not a great UIUX experience, but it still a great experience when I thinking, planning and implementing components and project'sstructure. You can experience webVR if you have something like google cardboard. The old website is still there that I can compare myself before. I think it's a good thing to rebuild your profolio website periodically. It can keep me passion and always enjoy to my job. Everyone has their way to keep going, embrace and face it.`,
    conclusion: `May it be the common wisdom to encourage ourselves. Cheers.`
